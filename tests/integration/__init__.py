"""Integration test suite for FlowGate.

These tests require a real environment and are skipped by default in CI.
To run integration tests, set the environment variable:

    RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 python -m unittest discover -s tests/integration -v

Or use the helper script:

    ./scripts/integration_test.sh
